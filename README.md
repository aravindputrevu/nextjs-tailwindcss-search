# Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Elasticsearch Example

This example shows how to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) [(v2.2)](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/tailwindcss-2-2) with Next.js. It follows the steps outlined in the official [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).

It uses the new [`Just-in-Time Mode`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode) for Tailwind CSS.

We will use Elasticsearch to ingest sample data, search it by using [Elasticsearch NodeJS](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/index.html) language client.
